# CS479/579 Reverse Engineering at NMSU
#### Camacho, Angel | Feb 1, 2023 | CS 479 | Week 2
---

Summary: Within this lab we took a look at two other viruses, both being .exe files, both of these files were flagged as viruses by Virustotal.com the first with an over all 85 virus flag rate, and the second one with an 82 percent virus flag rate.

From the tools that we used including UPX and Strings, it seemed like it both files were obfuscated, or the method of unpacking simply was not working on these specific files.

From the first libraries that were called we can infer that there was an ettempet for memory manipulation (kernell32.dll) and something to do with retreving the highest ordinal value GetProcAddress. 
The second libraries that were called which were KERNEL32.dll & Advapi32.dll which provides access to advanced core Windows components such
as the Service Manager and Registry.


Lab 1-3
Analyze the file Lab01-03.exe.

1. Upload the Lab01-03.exe file to http://www.VirusTotal.com/. Does it match
any existing antivirus definitions?

Yes, by 59 anti viruses, 11 anti viruses did not detect it, and 4 were unable to process it.

2. Are there any indications that this file is packed or obfuscated? If so,
what are these indicators? If the file is packed, unpack it if possible.


As demonstrated below there hasnt been any indicators that upacking lab01-03.exe has had any effect on strings output.
This means that it was either inefective or it wasn't obfuscated.

3. Do any imports hint at this programâ€™s functionality? If so, which imports
are they and what do they tell you?

At first glance I only recognize kernell32.dll, which may be used to access and manipulate memory, files, and hardware.

4. What host- or network-based indicators could be used to identify this malware on infected machines?

```

Lab 1-4
Analyze the file Lab01-04.exe
1. Upload the Lab01-04.exe file to http://www.VirusTotal.com/. Does it match any existing antivirus definitions?

Yes, 58 anti viruses detected it as some kind of malware. 13 anti viruses did not detect it, and 4 were unable to process it.

2. Are there any indications that this file is packed or obfuscated? If so,
what are these indicators? If the file is packed, unpack it if possible.
